	<h1>27 SEP 2020 Darius Eiland Interests and Hobbies</h1>
	<p>Hi class, my name is Darius Eiland. I am currently serving in the U.S. Air Force doing human resource work. I enjoy relaxing and
	occasionally playing video games. My hobbies include collecting sneakers, financial investing, and watching youtube. Although, I 
	have been in the military for the past seven years, I don't plan on retiring. I am single with no kids and and I don't expect that
	to change anytime soon. I would like to do more traveling at some point as I also enjoy  driving on the open road. Being able to
	afford nicer vehicles some day is definitly a goal of mine.<p>

	<p>With a degree in programming, and IT certifications, I aspire to work in the IT career field as a Full Stack Web Developer or perhaps a DevOps 
	(Developer Operations). Network Admistrator and IT Support Specialists are also good careers I am exploring. The great aspect of these careers in 
	my opinion is work autonomy giving you the freedom to work remotely and set your own hours. You can also freelance as a programmer/developer. The oppotunities 
	for career advancement and increasing pay presents the ideal job for me to pursue.<p>
